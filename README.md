mimic_alpha
===========

The function 'colorAlpha_to_rgb' returns a list of RGB color that mimic 
a RGBA on a given background
The code implements the algorithm from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2049230/convert-rgba-color-to-rgb?rq=1

The code has not been tested. 
A by eye comparison between a pdf image with alpha channel and 
a few values for the input color/alpha on white background shows that this approach is 'good enough'.
